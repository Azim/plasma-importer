# Plasma Importer
Editor tool to asset rip and import all the scripts needed for making component prefabs for game Plasma.

### Usage
1. Create new 3D Core Unity 2022.3.0f1 project
2. Window -> Package Manager -> + -> Add package from git URL... -> `https://github.com/Azim/plasma-importer.git`
3. PlasmaImporter -> Generate Project
4. Navigate to game's installation folder and open `Plasma_Data` folder, e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Plasma\Plasma_Data`
5. Grab a cup of tea and wait. After it's done, if you see errors in the console, reopen the unity project.

### What's planned
- Generate basic object tree for a component from context menu
- Maybe something about materials
